Since this will be mostly a software and technology-related blog, I think it's fitting that my first post should be an intro to the technology that powers this website: [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)

## What is Gatsby?

Gatsby is a JavaScript framework for creating a static website using React and GraphQL. The key word here is *static*. Static websites do not require JavaScript in order to display content. It means faster and more responsive websites for users, and fewer server costs for developers.

## Why Gatsby?

I chose Gatsby specifically because I wanted a [static site generator](https://www.staticgen.com/). Completely static web pages without any JavaScript running have become the overwhelmingly preferred way of generating personal sites.

I've already used Gatsby for a previous project. My experience was very positive, so I decided to return to it for my personal website.

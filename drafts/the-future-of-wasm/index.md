## Current State


## Predictions of the Future

These are some of the things I think will happen in the future.

### Permissions and Restrictions

One of the things I would like to see is a way to limit the computational resources that a wasm binary may access. 

One common criticism of WebAssembly is that it makes it easier to hide malicious code. That's already done in JavaScript - it's called obfusication. That being said, invisible cryptocurrency miners exploiting WebAssembly are fairly common right now.

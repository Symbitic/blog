Let me quote [Chuck](http://www.supernaturalwiki.com/Chuck_Shurley) (aka God): "Writing is hard."

I couldn't agree more. Letting words flow from my brain to my screen or pen is very difficult for me. It's especially hard for non-technical topics. I can explain science and technology pretty well, but writing words meant for people other than me feels increasingly difficult. But even that feels like its been taking a hit lately.

It makes me wonder: Why is writing so hard for me?

I think the biggest answer would be social isolation from the COVID-19 pandemic. I moved into a new apartment building in late 2020, so I never got the chance too meet any of my new neighbors. I haven't seen any of my colleagues in over a year, and it was recently announced that our HQ building won't be reopened for atleast another year. I don't have any close friends in the D.C. area.
